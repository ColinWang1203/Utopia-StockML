Utopia_winds : first make a huge scrolling bug for titles labeled with date, 
               then do a one week words predict next week, start by just see the picking the 80% most show word
               and make a dict for it, ex:
               model a : {'rise':20, 'good':10, 'OMG':5, ...} => rise_drop_ratio 10
               model b : {'rise':20, 'best':10, 'holy moly':5, ...} => rise_drop_ratio 20
               >> now we have a new one
               model c : {'rise':20, 'best':10, 'OMG':5, ...} => predict this is 50% like model a and b
               thus the rise_drop_ratio should be 10 * 0.5 + 20 * 0.5 = 15
Utopia_anubis : measure your strategy for one year, assume latest bb and always buy with end price
                define the input and output : 
                input : start_date, n_day_rise, n_day_stay_over_mid, ... (for param tuning)
                output: [sell apple_num_prev price, buy apple_num_next price] or null if stay still
                calculate the fortune in addidtion 
Utopia_lightening : get a line bot, send msg to me (1%=10% cal amount then send)
                    when a long rised one touch mid or touch low
                    (or even try to auto buy)
